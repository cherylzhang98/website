<h2>People often make prejudgments about people’s social background and appearance based on the way they speak, specifically when they talk in foreign accents, The minute we speak, we are giving clues about ourself — where we grew up, with whom we grew up, and where we went to school. Languages possess the power to shape narratives and build atmospheres within groups and communities.<br><br> This website will showcase audios from different speakers of Chinese descents, where it invites you to form ideas about them when you hear their voices.</h2>

<h2>It welcomes audiences to make guesses and judgements about the social background of the speaker by listening to the audio only before researching the speaker and clicking the speaker’s name for biological information. It is an interactive process for individuals themselves to distinguish if they make biased prejudgements unconsciously based on listening to the way people speak in the following audios.

<h1 style="color:#027EA8">SOCIAL EVALUATION</h1>
		
<p style="text-indent:50px">This study is conducted through examinations and evaluations of Asian accented English by English-speaking American listeners. The present study consisted of an online survey in which participants rated different voices on measures of ‘Attractiveness’, ‘Status’, and ‘Dynamism’. Three different Accent Conditions were used: Mainstream U.S. English [MUSE], Asian Accented English [AA], and Brazilian Portuguese Accented English [BP]. As predicted, the Asian Accented speakers were rated significantly lower than the MUSE speakers on all measures, and significantly lower than the Brazilian Portuguese speakers on two out of the three measures, supporting the hypothesis that Asian accents specifically are viewed negatively. 
</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px">Even on intelligence, a characteristic that forms a cornerstone of the ‘Model Minority’ stereotype of Asian Americans, Asian Accented voices were rated significantly lower than the other two groups. These results highlight the need for greater general awareness of language-based discrimination, as well as research into the often subtle, unconscious ways that attitudes about language manifest in social interaction.</p> 
		
<p style="text-indent:50px">There were 69 respondents (all of whom self-identified as native speakers of American English) whose data analyzed. The respondents ranged in age from 18–63, with a mean age of 27.03, and a median age of 25. They came from all over the United States, although not all areas were equally represented; the majority of respondents were from the Northeastern and Western United States (30 and 28, respectively), with many fewer from the Midwest (6) and South (5). The gender and race/ethnicity of the respondents was also unevenly distributed: 72% of the respondents were female, and 75% were white.</p>

	<h1 style="color:#027EA8">GENERALIZATION OF PRONUNCIATIONS ON <br>CHINESE ENGLISH SPEAKERS</h1>
	
	<p style="text-indent:50px">Problems with vowels: Chinese and English differ greatly in the number of vowels. While English has 15 vowels, Chinese has only 5 vowels. Because of this difference, Chinese learners need to learn how to pronounce many new vowels when they start to learn English.</p> 
	<p style="text-indent:50px">Problems with consonants: Chinese and English have roughly the same numbers of consonants. However, some English consonants do not exist in Chinese. This poses difficulties for Chinese learners trying to produce these consonants.</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent:50px">Suprasegmental problems: Suprasegmental aspects of pronunciation deal with rhythm, stress, and intonation in pronunciation (Ohata, 2004). Comparing Chinese and English phonology, it is evident that the two languages have distinct features in terms of rhythm, stress, and intonation.</p>
